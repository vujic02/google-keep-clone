    - Find your variables in project settings.
2. Firestore Cloud
    - Set up a new project.
    - Create firestore cloud for the project.
    - Add a new collection named ***notes***.
    - Add 1 document to the collection **notes**:
    - Add a field to that document named *title*, add as string, set some value to it.
    - Add another field to that document named *content*, add as string, set some value to it.
3.  Install dependencies\
